                        style="font-weight: 400;"> is a fusion of social networks and online trading on the financial
                        markets. It boils down to copying (mirroring) experienced traders’ deals. Unsurprisingly, it has

                <h3><strong>3 trading concepts and differences</strong></h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirror trading, social trading and copy trading are often confusingly
                        thought of as the same thing. Let’s elaborate on the actual differences.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><b>mirror trading </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">an
                        algorithmic trading strategy (robots) is applied. Transactions take place on trading servers,
                        not on the user (investor) side. A user evaluates automatic strategies, selects one, and
                        monitors it in his account.</span></p>
                <p><b>Copy trading </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is similar, except users follow real traders who
                        share signals via a trading platform that logs all transactions. An investor views it and
                        chooses to repeat whichever action. A trader sending signals is called a signal provider, though
                        he can use an auto-trading bot as well. Transactions take place on a trader’s device.</span></p>
                <p><b>Social trading </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a common umbrella term for copy and mirror
                        trading strategies. We may perceive it as an exchange of ideas about markets and trends. Traders
                        share their insights and operations, comment on the actions of others, etc. It mainly takes
                        place in social networks, instant messengers, and niche websites such as </span><a

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve selected 8 diverse social trading platforms in terms of trading

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most copy trading platforms, eToro does not offer signal
                        providers and brokers separately, eToro is a broker in itself. Despite regulation in the UK
                        (FCA), Australia (ASIC), and Cyprus (CySEC), eToro is not listed on any stock exchange, does not
                        provide annual reports, and does not have a parent bank.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To start working, one has to bring a minimum deposit of 200 USD. Demo
                        accounts are available to US citizens, but a valid (live) account is not. Statistics for each

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">eToro warns that social trading tools it provides are just for
                        informational purposes. Also, we like the fact that it actively cautions about the risks of
                        losing savings. However, the inability to limit the risks when copying signal providers is a
                        significant drawback.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinguishing feature of ZuluTrade is the number of traders to
                        copy. Although we could not find the exact number, it exceeds several thousands, possibly tens
                        of thousands. Another important feature is the ability to create a portfolio of interacting

                        London and managing social trading assets, founded in March 2012. As any well-regarded broker,
                        Darwinex is regulated by the UK financial market (FCA). It’s social platform is called DARWIN

                        can be evaluated in terms of risk, performance, experience. A great advantage is the risk
                        limiting option available, namely setting a max loss amount per month, e.g. $100.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signal copy service by Darwinex differs from conventional social
                        trading platforms. As you are invited to copy trading strategies, the initial index is 100, and
                        it increases or decreases (in contrast to Profit/Loss ratio in other brokers).</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for account opening, the minimum deposit is 500 USD, three
                        currencies to choose from (EUR, USD,&nbsp; GBP), via bank transfer, card payment or </span><a

                        be quite tough on beginners. Skilled investors, though, will enjoy useful data, e.g. broker
                        data, correlation statistics, risk assessment, drawdown stats, etc. The pool of signal providers
                        is huge, and most trading strategies require a live account and a fee (0 to 1,000 USD per
                        strategy). C2 subscription costs 49 USD. A 14-day free trial with a demo account is
                        available.</span></p>

                        others. It is free, yet to follow a specific signal provider (trader), one has to pay a fee that
                        varies from 30 up to 500 USD. MQL5 does not offer accounts and does not complete transactions
                        for customers. Essentially, it provides a web portal for trading analysis, social trading,
                        shared hosting service, and some other off-topic extra features.</span></p>

                        was introduced in 2010 targeting FX traders. It works with third-party brokers, therefore, a
                        minimum deposit depends on the selected broker, in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        any user. To assess the quality of trading strategies in Mirror Trading, the T-Score parameter
                        is used – the closer it’s value to 10, the better the strategy. Although, evaluation parameters
                        behind this system are not known.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk management settings per strategy are available, which is quite
                        outstanding. Drawdown is calculated for closed deals only and does not include drawdown for open

                <h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the advent of social trading platforms traders mainly had to
                        enter the game through brokers. Now, investors can create a portfolio of financial products, as
                        well as signal providers, i.e. traders as a financial instrument.&nbsp;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments are made by copying traders who have proven profitability
                        and who allow replicating deals automatically. New companies are emerging in mirror/copy/social
                        trading, yet only a few offer high-quality services.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for signal providers, it is more complicated. There’s no real data
                        on investor losses (no matter what you might see or hear), our impression is that it’s about 90%
                        on average. Compared to CFD trading, for example, with an average of 80% of investor deposit
                        losses, trust management is more treacherous.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before
                        you go into it, consider carefully whether you can afford losing your money.</span></p>

                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Q: How do signal providers and brokers earn money in copy trading?</strong><br>
                    <strong>A: </strong>When buying or selling an asset, you pay a commission, also called a spread. The
                    broker receives income primarily from spreads and commissions on transactions conducted by
                    customers. With copy trading buy/sell orders come from signal providers. Even if transactions result
                    in money loss, brokers and signal providers still get spreads. This leads to a tendency to raise the
                    number of operations. </p>

                    <strong>Q: How safe is social trading?</strong><br>
                    <strong>A: </strong>In most cases, social trading is not safe in terms of capital loss. This is
                    caused by fraudulent signal providers, absence of risk-limiting tools. Scam traders often do not
                    have a trading strategy, their main goal is to imitate profitability and trust, gain followers and
                    earn money through commissions. </p>

                    <strong>Q: Copy trading vs Mirror trading</strong><br>
                    <strong>A: </strong>In copy trading, you can select individual traders to follow by copying their
                    transactions or copying their entire investment strategy. Mirror trading implies automatic asset
                    trading based on algorithmic strategies, and not on individual transactions. </p>
